# MALARIA DETECTION

# INTRODUCTION

Welcome to this project on classifying malaria infections in cell images. The goal of this project is to develop a predictive model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to accurately determine whether a cell is infected or parasitized by malaria. The dataset used in this project contains numerous images of cells, each labeled to indicate whether the cell is infected or parasitized.
The main objective of this project is to create a reliable and accurate model that can classify cell images as either parasitized or infected with malaria. This model aims to assist medical professionals in making informed decisions by providing a tool that can quickly and accurately distinguish between parasitized and infected cells.
In this project, we will employ supervised learning algorithms with a focus on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). CNNs are particularly well-suited for image classification tasks due to their ability to automatically detect and learn features from images.
The following sections will cover the project's methodology, key findings, and the performance of various models in predicting whether a cell is parasitized or infected. We will provide insights into the data preprocessing steps, model architecture, training process, and evaluation metrics.
By the end of this project, we aim to deliver a robust and accurate predictive model that can aid medical stakeholders in identifying malaria-infected cells, thereby contributing to more efficient and accurate malaria diagnosis.
