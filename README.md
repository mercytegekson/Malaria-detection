# MALARIA DETECTION

# INTRODUCTION

Welcome to this project on classifying whether it is parasitized or infected with malaria .In this project, we will be focused on supervised learning algorithms and use CNN model which will predict whether a cell is infected, parasitized. This is based on a comprehensive dataset which contains several images and labels which state if the cell is infected or parasitized.

The main purpose of this project is to create a predictive model that accurately classifies whether a cell is infected or parasitized. This project aims to provide insights to medical stakeholders and in turn they will make informed decisions which help them distinguish a parasitized or infected.

In the following sections we will delve into the project's methodology, key findings and the models' performances in predicting a parasitized or infected.
